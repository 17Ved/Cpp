// Inline function in cpp --
// If a function is inline, the compiler places a copy of the code of that function at each point where the function is called at compile time.
//Any change to an inline function could require all clients of the function to be recompiled because compiler would need to replace all the 
//code once again otherwise it will continue with old functionality.
// use inline function for only those functions which are too small
// while doing recursion don't implement inline function
// also don't use static variable in inline function




// Static variable in c++
// Static keyword has different meanings when used with different types. We can use static keyword with:
// Static Variables : Variables in a function, Variables in a class
// Static Members of Class : Class objects and Functions in a class




// Default arguments in cpp --
// A default argument is a value provided in a function declaration that is automatically assigned by the compiler if the calling function doesnâ€™t provide a value for the argument. 
// In case any value is passed, the default value is overridden. 
// default arguments should be on extreme right side, don't declare your default arguments at the starting, it'll give you an error.




// Whenever const keyword is attached with any method(), variable, pointer variable, and with the object of a class it prevents that specific object/method()/variable to modify its data items value.
// Constant Variables:
// There are a certain set of rules for the declaration and initialization of the constant variables:

// The const variable cannot be left un-initialized at the time of the assignment.
// It cannot be assigned value anywhere in the program.
// Explicit value needed to be provided to the constant variable at the time of declaration of the constant variable.
// syntax to decalre const var -- const int var = 32;      // valid statement to decalre const
// const int var;
// const in var
// var =32;         THE ABOVE 3 LINES ARE INVALID DECALRATION OF CONST
